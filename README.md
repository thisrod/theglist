These are the checklists to set up a working environment for the Physics Theory group at Swinburne University of Technology.

Git workflow
---

The master branch contains the default checklists, with items that almost everyone will need to run.

You should create a branch named with your login, to hold checklist items that install your text editor, TeX macros, and other personal environment.  Pull the default branch into this regularly.

Checklists
---

backup puts your account into a "go ahead, nuke me, make my day" state.

terminal and gstar are the things to run when the upgrade finishes.

upgrade is how to upgrade OSX on your terminal.

python sets up the standard python/GPU environment, assuming pyenv has been installed (as it is in the restore checklists).

The /etc directory has copies of some elusive configuration files.  These are mentioned in the checklists at the point they are installed.
